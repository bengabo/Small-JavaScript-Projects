    genre:"metal",
    text: "Slayer's \"Live Intrusion\" is a concert video with a bit off stage antics thrown in between songs. \"Witching Hour\", one of the album\’s real treats, is the cover of a Venom’s classic. The band is being joined onstage by Machine Head’s Robb Flynn and Chris Kontos. That performance is almost worth the price of admission alone.",
